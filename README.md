### Basic Info:

If you wanna support what I do you can chuck some money to Inrixia@gmail.com on **[paypal.com](https://www.paypal.com/myaccount/transfer/homepage)**

**You can download the latest stable version from here: https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-PlexDownloader/releases**

This is a Node.js script to download the daily videos from [LMG Floatplane](https://linustechtips.com/main/store/) and format them to be viewed in [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/). You can also  view the raw files in the download folder.

This requires a **[Floatplane](http://floatplane.com)** subscription.

### **Install Guide**

 * Make sure you have **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** installed on your system to use this.
 * If you want to use **[Plex](https://www.plex.tv/)** to browse the files installed you must have it installed.
 * If you encounter any issues then feel free to create a issue here or just PM me on **[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) @Sir Inrix | <3#6950**.

I will be maintaining this as I use it.

If you want to open Plex files in your own Media Player eg, VLC, MPC-BE, WindowsMediaPlayer. Go and install this tampermonkey script here: **https://github.com/Kayomani/PlexExternalPlayer** **Important Note** for chrome users: https://github.com/Kayomani/PlexExternalPlayer/issues/16

If you want plex to update after downloading new videos (fixing the issue with some video titles not updating after being downloaded until you refresh metadata) you can read about the plex specific settings in **[Settings Info](https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-Downloader/blob/master/wiki/settings.md)**
