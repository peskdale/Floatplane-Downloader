If you want to change any other settings, you can do so now inside the settings.json file. More info on settings can be found here: **[Settings Guide](https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-PlexDownloader/blob/master/wiki/settings.md)**

6. **Plex Update:**

   **Note:** This requires plex to have been set-up already which is covered in the **[Plex Guide](https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-PlexDownloader/blob/master/wiki/plex.md)**

   If you want plex to update after downloading new videos (fixing the issue with some video titles not updating after being downloaded until you refresh metadata) set the localPlex setting to true if plex is installed on the same system the script is on, or set remotePlex to true if its installed on another PC.
   
   You can either fill out the other plex settings stated in the settings.json yourself now or run the script which will prompt you for what is needed.
   
   To get the plex section for Floatplane you can just do this:
   [![https://gyazo.com/df26f5bbb22fc5c70f2b8714a30ce54c](https://i.gyazo.com/df26f5bbb22fc5c70f2b8714a30ce54c.gif)](https://gyazo.com/df26f5bbb22fc5c70f2b8714a30ce54c)
   
   Note that the script gets the ID from that url, just pasting the url into the settings.json will not work.
   
   For remote plex the script will prompt you to enter your plex username and password, these are not saved but just used to generate a token the script can use to remotely trigger a section update. This token is saved into settings.json. The script will also prompt you for the remote servers IP and PORT if you have not entered those. The IP is the ip of the plex server you are trying to connect to and the port only needs to be entered if you are not using the default.
   
   For localPlex you also need to ensure that plexScannerInstall is correct, this should be correct by default unless you are not running Windows or have not installed plex to the default location.
   
   There is more information about the plex settings in the **[Settings Guide](https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-PlexDownloader/blob/master/wiki/settings.md)**.

7. **Profit?:**

   At this point you should be completely set-up and ready to go!  
   To start the script all you need to do is run the **Floatplane.bat** file.  
   If you want to start the script from console yourself, just use "**node float.js**"  

The script will download the videos into the videos folder along with their thumbnails. If you want to set-up Plex, read the guide here: **[Plex Guide](https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-PlexDownloader/blob/master/wiki/plex.md)**
