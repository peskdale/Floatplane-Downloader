# settings.json Info
---
This covers what each setting is and what you can change it to for after version 4.0.0 Please go read this for pre 4.0.0: [Settings_Pre_4.0.0](https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-Downloader/blob/master/wiki/settings_pre_4.0.0.md). 

Note that "max" type settings apply separately to each channel, so maxVideos set to 4 means 4 videos for Floatplane and BitWit Ultra etc for multiple channels, if you have more than one channel enabled.

As of v3.8.2 the script now can generate the section id from the url for the section as can be seen below: [![https://gyazo.com/df26f5bbb22fc5c70f2b8714a30ce54c](https://i.gyazo.com/df26f5bbb22fc5c70f2b8714a30ce54c.gif)](https://gyazo.com/df26f5bbb22fc5c70f2b8714a30ce54c)

The section is is the last number in the url.

You can also just enter the ID into the prompt the script gives, this prompt will only display if the section id is set to 0 which is the default.
